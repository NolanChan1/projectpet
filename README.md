# PROJECT PET (WIP)
An Tamagotchi imitation of sorts developed initially on Arduino, and which is currently being ported to work on a RaspberryPi.
This project makes use of the following pieces of hardware: a 128x32 SSD1306 monochrome OLED display, a WS2812B LED strip, 
two passive piezoelectric buzzers (RaspberryPi version only), and two(Arduino)/four(RaspberryPi) push buttons for user input.
 

## MOTIVATION
Initially for me to play around with the Arduino Pro Micro, and other pieces of hardware (e.x. monochrome I2C OLED display)
that I bought initially for a keyboard macro project. The RaspberryPi port is being worked on as a way for me to get some 
hands-on practice designing and developing a small object-oriented software project and to learn Python.


## DEMO
The following YouTube video shows a demo of an early version of the RaspberryPi port running (please excuse the poor video/audio
quality).

## IMPORTANT NOTES
THE PET SPRITES/FONT/MUSIC IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE NOT MINE. THE PET SPRITES IN PARTICULAR WERE TAKEN AND MODIFIED FROM TERRARIA
(SLIME AND BEE) AND STARDEW VALLEY (CHICKEN). THE MUSIC IN THE RASPBERRY PI VERSION IS FROM STARDEW VALLEY (OVERTURE) AND THE 
FONT WAS DOWNLOADED FROM: https://www.dafont.com/minecraftia.font.
